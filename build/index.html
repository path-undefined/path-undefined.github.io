    Undoubtedly, the whole world is in chaos now. I was one of them, who have believed that those uneducated people were to be blamed, since they had too much uncertainties, which led to be easily brainwashed once they saw any hope, and voted for the maniacs. But I realized that I was probably wrong, and the blame on the uneducated people is probably also not 100% right. Because those so-called “uneducated people” are probably the victims of the society in the first place.

        I think everyone would probably agree that the world is becoming more and more separated. It seems that all people have lost their patience, and don’t want to agree with each other anymore. They quarrel on the Internet all day long, and the different opinions in a country slowly piled up and fermented into conflicts between different groups of people. But why is that? And which attitude should I have facing this situation?

        In this world, being productive and efficient is a virtue. People are talking about how they can reach more and more goals in shorter and shorter time. So people should always have a set of clear goals and do whatever it takes to finish them one by one. Isn&#x27;t that the reason why people start to feel detached from what they enjoy? Detached from their lives? And what kind of a life that I want to live then?

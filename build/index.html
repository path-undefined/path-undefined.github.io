      When I&#x27;m going on a motorcycle trip, I always notice that no matter which road I choose, no matter where I visit, I always pass through a same place. No, I&#x27;m not talking about my home. But rather a random place, not a place that I&#x27;m familiar with, not that close to my home, I don&#x27;t plan it intentionally on the map, I don&#x27;t even know which place it is, but I just pass through it each time when I go on a motorcycle trip. It is just like a magical magnet, or a blackhole, always pulls me to it. Until I finally decided to look it on the map, and then there will be an &quot;Aha!&quot; moment — &quot;Aha! This is the place that I always pass through!&quot; And somehow, I just feel that this place has a strange connection with me.

        These days I&#x27;m practising typing almost each another day. Because of the new keyboard layout, my typing speed was about 15 to 20 WPM 3 month ago. Now it has increased to around 55 to 60 WPM. I think I have learnt quite a lot while practising typing speed, not only about the typing speed itself, but rather much more.

        There is a very interesting phnomenon in the IT-industry. You write a piece of code, which you think is deadly simple, intuitive and easy to be understand, and then you commit it, push it, and then you get the feedback from experienced developers that &quot;it is not clean&quot;, because &quot;you are repeating yourself, it is not DRY&quot; or &quot;it is the best practise to do this this and that but you are not doing it&quot;. It seems that those &quot;rules&quot; and &quot;best practises&quot; are objective. As a junior developer, it&#x27;s your duty to follow these objective rules.

        I have worked on a toy programming language for a while now. I call it a slightly IMproved C language, aka. IM/C. I like C language for its simplicity, closeness to hardware and the flexibility of manage the memory manually. Motivated by the idea to keep the language features that I like and to improve the lacking parts in C language, IM/C will be designed as a language which will be transpiled into C.

        I was one of them, who have believed that those uneducated people were to be blamed for the chaos in the world at the moment, since they had too much uncertainties, which led to be easily brainwashed once they saw any hope, and voted for the maniacs. But I realized that I was probably wrong, and the blame on the uneducated people is probably also not 100% right. Because those so-called &quot;uneducated people&quot; are probably the victims of the society in the first place.

  <h1>An Undefined Path of Life</h1>
<p>I have created this blog, because I find the usual way of travelling is not that attractive to me anymore.</p>
<p>For me, travelling is always about adventure. While on a trip, I want to experience something new, something unknown and something unexpected at all. I want to explore, and I want to be surprised.</p>
<p>But nowadays, to do a trip like that is not that easy. I decide to go somewhere. Before I depart, I would have already done a ton of researches about the place, which sites to see, how does it look like, what to avoid and what to expect. At the end, the trip itself looks like finishing a task. Either a plane, a train, a bus or the GPS in a car will take me to the destination. Go to the site directly and try to enjoy the scenery, take some photos and then come back. In this way, half of the joy of travelling is gone.</p>
<p>These days, I prefer to hop on my motorcycle without thinking that much, ride somewhere randomly and then try to find my way back. If I can&#39;t, I will eventually start my map App, so that I can come back home before it is getting dark.</p>
<p>In this case, the feeling of the trip is completely different. I have the freedom to go anywhere I want, I have the freedom to choose whichever road that I want to take. There is no GPS distracting me, so I have all the time to looking around, observe each and every sight, listen to all the noises, smell all kinds of different smells and feel the air flow and the temperature surrounding me. When I ride back, I have to observe each and every road sign, build the whole map in my head, I have to ask the locals for the directions.</p>
<p>In this way, I feel I am more attached to the trip itself, instead of abstract the whole trip into one single POI.</p>
<p>Thinking about life, isn&#39;t it the same? In this world, being productive and efficient is a virtue. People are talking about how they can reach more and more goals in shorter and shorter time. So people should always have a set of clear goals and do whatever it takes to finish them one by one. Isn&#39;t that the reason why people start to feel detached from what they enjoy? Detached from their lives?</p>
<p>Besides, what if we stand at the very edge of the human-being experiences. We are explorering something completely new. No one has ever written anything about it, and no one has even thought about it. What shall we do, if we are so used to going after a certain goal? How can we even figure out our orientation?</p>
<p>Fortunately, I don&#39;t have to be the &quot;goal-chaser&quot;. I am a free individual. If I can live a life, if I can survive in the world, why should I be affected by this &quot;standard&quot; way of life?</p>
<p>That&#39;s why from time to time, I just want to enjoy a life with the an undefined path. Just like riding motorcycle, I would set a rough direction, and start to enjoy my life without thinking too much. I just take whatever roads that I want to take. I don&#39;t need to catch a deadline. I don&#39;t have to reach a certain performance. I don&#39;t have to do anything to impress any one. I don&#39;t have to yield any result. I&#39;m just on my own, ready for being surprised, ready for explorations, ready for getting into trouble and fine my way out, ready for reaching out the knowledgeable people to listen to their wisdom, and ready for learning something new. In this case, when I lay on my death bed, I would say, &quot;oh, life was generous to me. I feel fulfilled and satisfied.&quot;</p>
<p>So, why not start from now on?</p>
